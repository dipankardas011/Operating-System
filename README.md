# Building the Custom Operating System

All the reference are from the GNI UNIX and Linux
and its a abstract layer just to learn about the kernel and OS design

## Components
- [x] CPU
- [ ] File
- [x] Memory Management
- [ ] Permission
- [x] Library

## Currently how to RUN
1. to test the stack you can compile `stack.c` under `impl/`
2. to test the scheduling you can run the script `./runner.sh` under `CPU/`

## What I leaned
1. How to make compile multiple C src using makefile and run them using bash script
2. How and what the basic components for an operating system
3. Implement Generic Queue, Stack for the scheduling algorithms
